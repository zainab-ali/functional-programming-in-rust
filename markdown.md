# Birthday app  

## Today is 6th August 2024.

```bash
./birthday 2000-08-06   # My birthday is today
Happy birthday! Congratulations on becoming 24!
```

```bash
./birthday 2000-08-08   # My birthday is soon
It's not your birthday yet. Wait for 2 more days.
```

```bash
./birthday 2000-08-05   # My birthday was yesterday
You've already had your birthday. I hope you had fun!
```

---
class: middle

# Rule

## If it's not my birthday yet, I should wait for at least one day.

# üêõ The bug

## It's close to midnight on the 5th August.
```bash
./birthday 2000-08-06
It's not your birthday yet. Wait for 0 more days.
```

# Functional programming techniques
 - Write pure functions
 - Identify side effects
 - Modelling data with types
 - Write total functions
 
---
class: middle
# Pure functions

```rust
let x = 1 + 2;
// Is equivalent to
let x = 3;
```
```rust
let is_empty = Some(5).is_empty();
// Is equivalent to
let is_empty = false;
// And also equivalent to
let is_empty = match Some(5) {
 Some(_) => false,
 None => true
};
```
???

TODO: check this match statement compiles

class: middle
# Side effects

```rust
let x = println!("Happy birthday!");
// Is not equivalent to
let x = ();
```

```rust
let x = today();
// Is not equvalent to
let x = NaiveDate::of_ymd(2024,08,06);
```

```rust
let x = sys::env::args();
// Is not equivalent to
let x = vec!["birthday", "2024-08-06"];
```

# Œª Rewriting the code

```rust
fn main() -> () {
    // Side effects
    let today = get_today();
    let dob_string = get_arg();
	// Pure code
    let dob = calc_dob(dob_string);
    let birthday = calc_birthday(today, dob);
	// Printing
    if birthday == today {
	   ...
    } else if birthday < today {
	   ...
    } else {
        println!(
            "It's not your birthday yet. Wait for {} more days.",
            calc_days_until_birthday(today, birthday)
        );
    }
}
```
